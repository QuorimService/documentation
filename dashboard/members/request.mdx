The **Join Requests** page allows server owners and administrators to review users requesting access to the server.

Requests are created when users join using a **server join code**.

## Managing Requests

For each request, you can:
- **Accept** the request
- **Deny** the request

You can also use bulk actions:
- **Accept All**
- **Deny All**

Once accepted, users are added to the server with the **Member** role by default.
