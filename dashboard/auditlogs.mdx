The **Audit Logs** page provides a detailed, real-time history of important actions performed within your server.

Audit logs help server owners and administrators maintain **transparency**, **accountability**, and **security**.

All logs shown here apply **only to the currently selected server**.

Audit logs record key actions related to server access and ownership.

Each log entry includes:
