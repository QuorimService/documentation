## Top Performers

The **Top Performers** section uses a sophisticated weighted scoring system that balances combat skill, server dedication, and overall activity to identify your most valuable players.

### Performance Score Formula
Our scoring system rewards well-rounded players who contribute to server health through multiple dimensions:
| Metric | Points | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| **Kills** | **+20 pts** | Rewards combat skill and PvP engagement |
| **Playtime** (per hour) | **+50 pts** | Values server dedication and consistent activity |
| **Commands Used** | **+2 pts** | Encourages feature exploration and engagement |
| **Deaths** | **−5 pts** | Slight penalty to balance pure aggression |
<Callout icon="trophy" color="#FFC107" iconType="duotone">
**Top Performers are ranked by overall impact** — not just kills. This holistic approach identifies players who contribute to server health through combat, dedication, and active participation.
</Callout>

### Understanding the Scoring System
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why Playtime is Weighted Heavily" icon="clock">
    Playtime receives the highest point value (+50 per hour) because:
    
    - Consistent players build community and mentor new members
    - Server dedication indicates long-term investment and loyalty
    - Active players contribute to a vibrant, populated environment
    - Playtime correlates with overall server health and retention
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Balancing Combat and Activity" icon="scale-balanced">
    The scoring system intentionally balances combat prowess with overall engagement:
    
    - **Pure combat players**: High kills but low playtime may rank lower
    - **Dedicated players**: Consistent activity with moderate combat ranks highly
    - **Well-rounded players**: Balanced kills, playtime, and feature usage rank highest
    
    This prevents the leaderboard from becoming purely combat-focused and rewards diverse playstyles.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Death Penalty Explained" icon="skull">
    The -5 point death penalty serves multiple purposes:
    
    - **Prevents reckless play**: Discourages mindless aggression without strategy
    - **Rewards tactical gameplay**: Players who engage smartly rank higher
    - **Balances K/D ratio**: Works alongside kill rewards for fair assessment
    - **Minimal impact**: Small enough not to punish normal gameplay
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
### Top Performers Display
The Top Performers section showcases:
- **Rank badges**: Visual indicators for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place
- **Player avatars**: Profile pictures for easy recognition
- **Performance score**: Total calculated points based on the formula
- **Key stats**: Breakdown of kills, playtime, and other contributing metrics
<Tip>
Use Top Performers data to identify community leaders, potential moderators, or players who deserve special recognition through in-game rewards or exclusive roles.
