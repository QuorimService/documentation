The **Dashboard** is your main control center in Quorim.  
This is where you manage your servers, view your access level, and jump into analytics and tools.

Once logged in, you’ll land here by default.

## Your Servers

The **Your Servers** section lists every server you have access to.

Each server row shows:
- **Server name**
- **Your role** (Owner, Admin, Member)
- **Member count**
- **Manage button** for server access

This allows you to quickly understand what permissions you have on each server.

## Managing a Server

Click **Manage** on any server to access:
- Analytics dashboards
- Player search and profiles
- Flags and moderation context
- Server settings and configuration
- Team and access management

Each server is isolated, meaning data and settings do not overlap between servers.

<Info>
Analytics data may not appear instantly for newly created servers.
