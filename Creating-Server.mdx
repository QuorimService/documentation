# Create a Server

To use Quorim, you must first create a server and connect it to your **Roblox PRC (Police Roleplay Community)** and **Discord server**.

<Warning>
  **You must own the PRC API Pack for analytics to function.**
  
  Quorim relies on PRC's official API to collect analytics. Purchase the API Pack before proceeding with server creation.
</Warning>
