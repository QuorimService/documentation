Flags are indicators used by Quorim to highlight **potentially risky, suspicious, or noteworthy behavior** associated with a player or account.

These flags help server owners and staff make **informed moderation decisions**.  
Flags do **not** automatically imply wrongdoing — they provide additional context based on verified or historical signals.

Flags may appear in:
- **Player Search**
- **Player profiles**
- **User information panels** within Quorim

## How Flags Work

- Flags are assigned **only by Quorim Administrators**
- Assignments are based on **internal review, verified evidence, and trusted reports**
- Some flags may be permanent, while others can be reviewed or updated over time
- Flags are informational and should be used as **guidance**, not as automatic punishment
<Info>
Only <strong>Quorim Administrators</strong> have the ability to assign, update, or remove flags.
