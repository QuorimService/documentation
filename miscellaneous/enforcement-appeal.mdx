We understand that enforcement actions can be frustrating, especially for paid users.  
This page explains **why actions may be taken**, **what each action means**, and **how appeals are handled**.

All enforcement decisions are made in accordance with Quorim’s [**Terms of Service**](https://quorim.xyz/terms).

---

## Types of Enforcement Actions

### Suspension

A **suspension** is a temporary restriction of access to part or all of the Quorim platform.

Suspensions may be used to:
- Investigate potential violations
- Mitigate ongoing risk or abuse
- Enforce temporary restrictions

Access may be restored automatically or after internal review.

<Info>
Suspensions are not permanent and may be lifted once a review is completed.
</Info>

---

### Termination

A **termination** is the permanent revocation of access to Quorim.

As stated in our [Terms of Service](https://quorim.xyz/terms):
- Termination may occur **with or without cause**
- Termination may occur **with or without prior notice**
- Terminated accounts are **soft-deleted for up to 30 days**, after which data may be permanently deleted

<Danger>
Termination results in the loss of platform access and may be irreversible.
</Danger>

## Why Was Action Taken?

We take all enforcement decisions seriously. Common reasons include, but are not limited to:

| Reason | Description |
|------|------------|
| **Misuse of Service** | Using Quorim in violation of the Terms of Service or Acceptable Use Policy. |
| **Underage Access** | Accessing the platform while under the minimum age requirement. |
| **Impersonation** | Impersonating Quorim, Quorim staff, or another individual or entity. |
| **Misinformation** | Knowingly spreading false or misleading information about Quorim or its staff. |
| **Abusive or Malicious Activity** | Engaging in behavior that poses risk to users, systems, or third parties. |
| **Payment Abuse / Chargebacks** | Initiating chargebacks or abusing billing systems. |

## Who Makes These Decisions?

<Info>
All suspensions and terminations are reviewed and enforced by the <strong>Quorim Core Team</strong> and authorized administrators.
</Info>

Decisions are based on:
- Internal investigations
- Verified reports
- Historical account behavior
- Platform risk and abuse signals

---

## How Do Appeals Work?

If you believe an enforcement action was taken in error, you may submit an appeal.

### Appeal Process

To appeal, email our support team with the following information:

- Discord username and **Discord User ID**
- The affected account or server
- A clear explanation of why you believe the action was incorrect
- Any supporting evidence (if applicable)

Appeals are reviewed periodically. Please allow **up to 2–3 weeks** for review.

<Note>
Appeals are reviewed internally. Promises such as “it won’t happen again” or “time has passed” do not typically result in reversal.
</Note>

If your appeal is successful, you will receive a response.  
If you do not receive a response within the review window, the appeal should be considered denied.

## Refunds & Billing

As stated in our Terms of Service:

- Refunds are **not provided** for suspensions or terminations
- Early termination does not entitle users to unused time or credits
- Chargebacks may result in immediate termination

<Warning>
Do not contact support requesting refunds for enforcement actions.
</Warning>

---

## Duration of Enforcement Actions

- **Suspensions** may be temporary or indefinite
- **Terminations** are typically permanent

---

## Reporting Violations

We accept reports for violations of **Quorim’s Terms of Service only**.

Reports related solely to community-specific rules (such as roleplay behavior or chat moderation) are not grounds for platform-wide enforcement.

Valid reports may be submitted through official Quorim support channels.

---

## Final Notes

<Info>
Quorim reserves the right to suspend or terminate access at any time, with or without notice, as outlined in the Terms of Service.
</Info>

This page exists to provide transparency and clarity, not to limit Quorim’s enforcement authority.
