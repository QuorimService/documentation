## Creating a PRC Server

Before accessing analytics, you must create a server inside Quorim and link it to your PRC.

Once a server is created:
- Initial data processing may take time for large PRC communities
- Data is collected gradually to avoid Roblox and Discord rate limits
- Analytics update automatically as new data is processed

This ensures stable tracking even for servers with high daily player counts.
